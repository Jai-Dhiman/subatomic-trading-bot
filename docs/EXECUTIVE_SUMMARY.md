# Executive Summary - Energy Trading System POC

## The Big Picture

**Problem**: California households pay high electricity costs, especially during peak hours (4-8pm).

**Solution**: AI-powered peer-to-peer energy trading network where households with batteries autonomously buy and sell energy to maximize savings.

**Goal**: Demonstrate 20-40% cost savings vs standard PG&E rates in a 2-week proof-of-concept.

---

## How It Works

### The Players

1. **10 Households ("Nodes")**
   - Each has a battery (13.5 kWh capacity)
   - Each has a Transformer AI model predicting its energy usage
   - Each makes autonomous trading decisions
   - Each learns from its own data (privacy-preserving)

2. **Central Model**
   - Sets market price signals based on supply/demand
   - Aggregates learning from all nodes (FedAvg)
   - Enforces market rules (e.g., 10 kWh/day sell limit)

3. **Market Mechanism**
   - Matches buyers and sellers instantly
   - Handles transactions in 30-minute intervals
   - Accounts for 5% transmission losses

### The Flow

```
Every 30 minutes:
1. Central broadcasts current price signal
2. Each node predicts its upcoming energy needs (next 3 hours)
3. Each node decides: Buy? Sell? Hold?
4. Market matches trades instantly
5. Batteries charge/discharge accordingly
6. Costs are tracked vs PG&E baseline

Every 3 hours:
7. Nodes share model updates with central
8. Central aggregates and redistributes improved model
```

## The Technology

### Smart Prediction

- **Transformer Neural Network** learns household patterns
- **Inputs**: 24 features including appliance usage, battery sensors, weather, temporal data, and pricing
- **Output**: Multi-horizon forecasts (day, week, month) with 30-minute granularity

### Smart Trading

- **Buy when**: You need energy AND market price < PG&E price
- **Sell when**: You have excess AND market price > your cost
- **Hold when**: Neither trade makes sense

### Smart Battery Management

- Charge during cheap off-peak hours
- Discharge during expensive peak hours
- Keep 10% reserve for emergencies
- Never exceed 80% capacity (battery health)

## Why This Saves Money

### Strategy 1: Time Shifting

Instead of buying at peak rates ($0.51/kWh), buy at off-peak ($0.28/kWh) and store in battery.

**Savings**: ~45% on time-shifted energy

### Strategy 2: Peer-to-Peer Trading

Buy from neighbors at market rates instead of always from grid.

**Savings**: ~15-25% on traded energy

### Strategy 3: Prediction-Based Optimization

Only charge/trade what you actually need, avoiding waste.

**Savings**: ~5-10% from reduced waste

### Combined Result

**Target: 20-40% total savings** on electricity costs

## The POC Simulation

### What We're Building

- **Not**: Real hardware integration
- **Yes**: Software simulation proving the concept

### The Test

- 10 simulated households
- 1 full day of trading (48 thirty-minute intervals)
- 1 year of historical data for training
- Realistic consumption patterns (fridge, EV, A/C, etc.)
- Real PG&E TOU-C pricing for California

### Success Looks Like

```json
{
  "baseline_pge_cost": "$22.45",
  "optimized_cost": "$15.32",
  "savings": "$7.13",
  "savings_percent": "31.7%",
  "trades_executed": 127,
  "battery_efficiency": "92%"
}
```
