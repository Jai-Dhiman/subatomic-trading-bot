# Business Rules & Trading Strategy

**Updated**: October 8, 2025  
**Focus**: Profit Maximization through Strategic Energy Trading

---

## üí∞ **Business Model**

### Revenue Streams
1. **Household Service**: Charge households **$270/MWh ($0.27/kWh)** for electricity
2. **Market Trading**: Buy low from market, sell high to market
3. **Battery Optimization**: Minimize holding costs, maximize utilization

### Goal
**Maximize total profit** = Household Revenue + Market Profit - Buy Costs

---

## üéØ **Hard Rules** (Non-Negotiable)

### Rule 1: Always Buy Below $20/MWh
```
IF market_price < $20/MWh AND battery_soc < 100%:
    BUY (as much as possible)
```
- **Rationale**: Prices below $20/MWh are exceptionally cheap
- **Action**: Fill battery to maximize future profit potential
- **Constraint**: Only if battery has capacity (SoC < 100%)

### Rule 2: Always Sell Above $40/MWh
```
IF market_price > $40/MWh AND battery_soc > 20%:
    SELL (excess power)
```
- **Rationale**: Prices above $40/MWh are profitable
- **Action**: Sell un-needed power to market
- **Constraint**: Keep enough for household demand + buffer

### Rule 3: Hold When SoC Below 20%
```
IF battery_soc <= 20%:
    HOLD (safety threshold)
```
- **Rationale**: Protect battery health and ensure household power
- **Action**: No discharge below 20%
- **Constraint**: Absolute minimum

### Rule 4: Hold When Price Below 10% of Grid
```
IF market_price < $27/MWh (10% of $270/MWh):
    HOLD (price too low)
```
- **Rationale**: Not worth selling at such low prices
- **Action**: Wait for better market conditions
- **Constraint**: Minimum acceptable price floor

## üìã **Priority List** (In Order)

### Priority 1: Match Household Power Demands
```
MUST: Ensure enough energy for household consumption
```
- **Target**: Meet 100% of predicted daily consumption
- **Buffer**: Keep 5% safety margin
- **Critical**: This is non-negotiable - households must have power

### Priority 2: Sell (Max Capacity - Daily Usage)
```
Sellable Capacity = Battery Max Capacity - Daily Predicted Usage
```
- **Calculation**: 
  - If battery is 40 kWh and daily usage is 30 kWh
  - Sellable capacity = 10 kWh
- **Action**: Sell this excess when market price > $40/MWh

### Priority 3: Sell Remaining Un-needed Power
```
IF battery_soc > target_soc AND price > threshold:
    Sell excess to market
```
- **Target SoC**: 60% (comfortable operating level)
- **Action**: Sell power above this level when profitable
- **Benefit**: Reduce holding costs, increase profit

### Priority 4: Minimize Excess Battery Storage
```
Penalty for holding power when:
- Battery SoC > 80% AND price > $20/MWh
- Good selling opportunity exists but holding
```
- **Rationale**: Holding power has opportunity cost
- **Action**: Bias towards selling excess
- **Benefit**: Maximize capital efficiency

## üèÜ **Reward Mechanism**

### For Transformer Training

**Primary Objective**: Maximize Profit

```python
total_profit = household_revenue + market_profit - buy_costs

Where:
- household_revenue = consumption * $0.27/kWh
- market_profit = sell_revenue - buy_costs
- sell_revenue = sell_quantity * market_price
- buy_costs = buy_quantity * market_price
```

### Loss Function Weights
- **20%**: Price prediction accuracy (guidance)
- **20%**: Trading decision correctness (rules compliance)
- **60%**: Profitability reward (PRIMARY GOAL)

### Reward Calculation
```
higher_profit ‚Üí lower_loss ‚Üí better_model
```

### Penalties
1. **Excess Storage**: Holding power when could profitably sell
2. **Missed Opportunities**: Not buying at < $20/MWh
3. **Poor Timing**: Selling at < $40/MWh when could wait

## üìä **Example Scenarios**

### Scenario 1: Cheap Market Price
```
Market Price: $15/MWh ($0.015/kWh)
Battery SoC: 50%
Action: BUY maximum amount
Rationale: Price < $20/MWh, excellent buying opportunity
```

### Scenario 2: Expensive Market Price
```
Market Price: $60/MWh ($0.060/kWh)
Battery SoC: 70%
Household Demand: 2 kWh (next 4 hours)
Action: SELL 8 kWh (keep 2 kWh + buffer)
Rationale: Price > $40/MWh, sell excess while meeting demand
```

### Scenario 3: Mid-Range Price
```
Market Price: $30/MWh ($0.030/kWh)
Battery SoC: 40%
Action: HOLD
Rationale: Price between thresholds, wait for better opportunity
```

### Scenario 4: Low Battery
```
Market Price: $50/MWh ($0.050/kWh)
Battery SoC: 22%
Action: HOLD (mostly)
Rationale: Near safety threshold, prioritize household demand
```

## üí° **Business Logic Summary**

### Decision Tree
```
1. Is SoC <= 20%?
   ‚Üí YES: HOLD (safety)
   ‚Üí NO: Continue

2. Is price < $27/MWh (10% of household rate)?
   ‚Üí YES: HOLD (too cheap to sell)
   ‚Üí NO: Continue

3. Is price < $20/MWh AND SoC < 100%?
   ‚Üí YES: BUY (excellent price)
   ‚Üí NO: Continue

4. Is price > $40/MWh AND SoC > 20%?
   ‚Üí YES: SELL excess (profitable)
   ‚Üí NO: Continue

5. Is SoC > 80% AND price > $20/MWh?
   ‚Üí YES: SELL excess (reduce storage)
   ‚Üí NO: HOLD
```
