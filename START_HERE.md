# START HERE - Transformer Pre-Flight

**Created:** 2025-10-08  
**Status:** Ready to begin implementation  
**Goal:** Verify full Transformer architecture with synthetic data before real data arrives

---

## What You Have Now

### Documentation (Complete ‚úÖ)
- `docs/TRANSFORMER_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Full 9-phase implementation plan
- `docs/TRANSFORMER_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Quick reference guide
- `docs/TRANSFORMER_PRE_FLIGHT_PLAN.md` - **This week's focus: Pre-flight with synthetic data**
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PHASE_1_PRICING_ONLY.md` - Simplified version (skip this)

### Existing Code (Production-Ready ‚úÖ)
- Battery management system
- Trading logic and market mechanism
- Grid constraints enforcement
- Profitability calculator
- Federated learning (FedAvg)
- Supabase pricing data (40,200 records)

### What's Missing (Your Tasks This Week)
- Synthetic data generator
- Full feature engineering (24 features)
- EnergyTransformer model (~12M parameters)
- Local training script
- Tests for pipeline
- Updated config.yaml

---

## The Strategy

**Decision:** Build the **FULL** multi-task Transformer now, train on synthetic data first.

**Why?**
- Real data (appliances, battery, weather) coming soon
- Better to verify architecture works now
- When real data arrives, just swap data source
- Faster than incremental approach

**What We're NOT Doing:**
- ‚ùå Pricing-only simplified version (Phase 1A)
- ‚ùå LSTM models (outdated)
- ‚ùå Waiting for real data to start

## Your Todo List (7 Tasks)

I've already added these to your Warp todo list. Here's the order:

### Task 1: Create Synthetic Data Generator ‚è±Ô∏è 1 hour
**File:** `src/data_integration/synthetic_data_generator.py`

Generate 7-10 days of realistic household data:
- 9 appliances with realistic patterns
- 4 battery sensor readings
- 2 weather features
- Pricing data

**Start Here:**
```bash
cd /Users/jdhiman/Documents/energymvp
touch src/data_integration/synthetic_data_generator.py
```

Reference: `docs/TRANSFORMER_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` Phase 2 has appliance pattern specs.

---

### Task 2: Full Feature Engineering ‚è±Ô∏è 1.5 hours
**File:** `src/models/feature_engineering.py`

Extract all 24 features from synthetic data:
- 9 appliance + 4 battery + 2 weather + 4 temporal + 5 pricing

**Note:** `feature_engineering_v1.py` exists but only handles pricing (9 features). You need the FULL version (24 features).

Reference: `docs/TRANSFORMER_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` Phase 2 has complete code.

---

### Task 3: Full EnergyTransformer Model ‚è±Ô∏è 2 hours
**File:** `src/models/transformer_model.py`

Implement production architecture:
- d_model: 512, n_heads: 8, n_layers: 6
- Multi-task heads (consumption + price)
- Multi-horizon outputs (day, week, month)
- ~12M parameters

Reference: `docs/TRANSFORMER_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` Phase 3 has complete code.

---

### Task 4: Local Training Script ‚è±Ô∏è 1 hour
**File:** `src/training/train_transformer_local.py`

Create training loop for CPU/local GPU:
- Load synthetic data
- Train 5-10 epochs
- Verify loss decreases
- Save checkpoint

Reference: See Task 4 in `docs/TRANSFORMER_PRE_FLIGHT_PLAN.md`

---

### Task 5: Automated Tests ‚è±Ô∏è 30 min
**File:** `tests/test_transformer_pipeline.py`

Test everything:
- Synthetic data generation
- Feature engineering
- Transformer model
- Training pipeline
- End-to-end

Reference: See Task 5 in `docs/TRANSFORMER_PRE_FLIGHT_PLAN.md`

---

### Task 6: Update Config ‚è±Ô∏è 15 min
**File:** `config/config.yaml`

Replace LSTM config with Transformer config:
- Remove old `model:` section
- Add new `transformer:` section with all parameters

Reference: See Task 6 in `docs/TRANSFORMER_PRE_FLIGHT_PLAN.md`

---

### Task 7: Run & Document ‚è±Ô∏è 1-2 hours
Execute complete pipeline and document results in `docs/PRE_FLIGHT_RESULTS.md`

---

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Check your current directory
pwd  # Should be: /Users/jdhiman/Documents/energymvp

# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install any missing dependencies (if needed)
uv pip install torch scikit-learn pandas numpy pytest

# Start with Task 1
touch src/data_integration/synthetic_data_generator.py
# Then implement the generator...

# Test as you go
python src/data_integration/synthetic_data_generator.py
python src/models/feature_engineering.py
python src/models/transformer_model.py
python src/training/train_transformer_local.py
pytest tests/test_transformer_pipeline.py -v
```

---

## Expected Outcomes

### After Task 1-3 (Day 1)
- Can generate synthetic data
- Can extract 24 features
- Model instantiates with ~12M parameters
- All components tested individually

### After Task 4-7 (Day 2)
- Model trains without errors
- Loss decreases over epochs
- All tests pass
- Results documented
- **Architecture verified! ‚úÖ**

---

## What Happens Next?

Once pre-flight succeeds:

1. **Wait for real data** - Appliances, battery sensors, weather from Supabase
2. **Create real data loader** - Similar to synthetic generator
3. **Swap data source** - One line change in training script
4. **Retrain on Colab GPU** - Much faster than CPU
5. **Integrate with trading system** - Use predictions for buy/sell decisions
